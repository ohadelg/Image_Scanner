        "2.  Keep it as simple as possible.\n"
        "3.  Explain yourself to the model, including several examples to help it understand the task.\n"
        "4.  To get clean results, force the model to return a single answer. (example: 'Return just one of the options: dog, cat, cow as output.')\n"
        "5.  For best results, ensure your images are well-lit and in focus. Blurry or dark images can hinder the model's ability to accurately interpret the content."
        "6.  If you're looking for specific details, make sure your prompt highlights them. For instance, instead of just 'describe the car,' try 'describe the make, model, and color of the car.'"

    # Placeholder for API key status, if we want to move that check display here too.
    # For now, API key status is checked and displayed in the main app.py.
    # If get_gemini_client is imported here, it might create circular dependency issues
    # if gemini_utils also needs config from app_config that ui_sidebar might eventually need.
    # Keeping API status in app.py is fine.
    # Example:
    # api_key_status = st.session_state.get("api_key_configured", False)
    # if api_key_status:
    #     st.sidebar.success("Gemini API Client initialized.")
    # else:
    #     st.sidebar.error("Gemini API Client not configured.")
