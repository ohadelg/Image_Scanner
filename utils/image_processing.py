# This file is a placeholder for any image processing functions you might need.
# For example, resizing, format conversion, etc.
# For the current project scope, Gemini VLM handles most image inputs directly,
# so this might remain empty or be used for more advanced preprocessing later.

    """
    Placeholder function for image preprocessing.
    Currently, this function does nothing and returns the image bytes as is.
    You can expand this if specific preprocessing is needed.

    # Example:
    # from PIL import Image
    # from io import BytesIO
    # img = Image.open(image_bytes)
    # # Perform some processing like resizing
    # # img = img.resize((new_width, new_height))
    # output_io = BytesIO()
    # img.save(output_io, format=img.format)
    # return output_io.getvalue()
