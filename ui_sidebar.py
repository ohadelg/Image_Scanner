        "3.  Explain yourself to the model, including several examples to help it understand the task.\n"
        "4.  To get clean results, force the model to return a single answer. (example: 'Return just one of the options: dog, cat, cow as output.')\n"
        "5.  For best results, ensure your images are well-lit and in focus. Blurry or dark images can hinder the model's ability to accurately interpret the content.\n"
        "6.  If you're looking for specific details, make sure your prompt highlights them. For instance, instead of just 'describe the car,' try 'describe the make, model, and color of the car.'"
